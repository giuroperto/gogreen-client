## Why Go Green?

Go Green was founded in 2020 by four friends during the Web Development course at Ironhack São Paulo. 

The company was born from our interest in **reducing meat consumption** and making the transition as easy as possible for our users - chefs, cooks, and the curious! 

We offer a tool where people can share their recipes and also contribute to third party recipes, through evaluations or even proposing changes. 

We hope to encourage more people to opt for meatless food, thereby reducing the impacts on the environment :earth_americas:, personal health :muscle: and animal welfare :cow:.

## The App

Go Green consists in an information sharing platform and social network based on vegetarian and vegan recipes.

As a public open-source application, user do not need to sign in in order to see recipes details.

On the other hand, the fast sign up form allow user to contribute adding new recipe and editing it when needed.

#### Step-by-step
